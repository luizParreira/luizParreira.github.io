During my earlier life as a student, I never saw the point of dedicating my time to learn the techniques that could make me a better writer. In school, my thought was that I needed to learn the essential to be able to pass the university test, once that's done, the rest would just come naturally. Portuguese, my birth language, have always felt natural to me, I kind of self educated myself on what are the best practices of it.

Fast forward to 2015, here I am in my early 20's dedicating most of my time learning to code. Since I started making more sense of it, I realised that many skills required to make me a good programmer are also ones that involve entire other disciplines, such as mathematics, philosophy and, surprisingly enough grammar.

In its essence, computer programs are instructions given to a computer execute the task you want it to. Much like when you want to cook something, and you write down all the ingredients and the process of getting the dish ready, or you just google it, but either way when you read it, you are telling your brain to execute those instructions so you can eat a yummy food. 

The process to write this instructions, is much like the process that a writer would go through in his/her heads to write a book or an essay, obvious things would differ, but the abstract idea of bringing all these thoughts into a real thing that is organised and people can make sense of is the same mental exercise. Furthermore, when developing any piece of software, documenting it is a big part of it, you want to understand what that function / method is doing when you come across this bit of code in the future.

As of now, I clearly see that learning grammar is one of the best use of my time. It can help me organise my thoughts in a clearer way, help me improve my communications on professional and personal occasions, and also, make me a better programmer, which is the ultimate goal of my career at the moment. 

To conclude, writing well is as important as speaking well and it could make a difference when it comes to getting that dream job, so learn it properly.

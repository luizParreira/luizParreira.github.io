```Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Luiz!```

I have been willing to start a blog in quite a while, I feel my writing is terrible and there is nothing better than practice to improve your skills at any trait. This is actually a big part of what this post is all about, the discovery of a transformative addiction, code. Now forgive me if my english is not so good, I haven't spoken much of it in nearly 2 years, I will do my best to not make any major mistakes.

Exactly one year ago in July, 2014 , I decided to try my luck and spend my, mostly wasted, hours on something that I had never thought I would be able to learn, programming. I've never been the smartest kid in maths and, for me, this programming stuff was for nerds and really smart people. I was all about partying and having a good time with friends, in the real world, not sitting in front of a computer all day. 

Well, it turns out that most of us do not know ourselves that well when we are 20 years old, and I was happily wrong, this programming stuff really is the hottest thing to know in my lifetime [0]. When you begin to understand it and reflect upon it,  what it means for the current and future generations, be part of a movement of people who are creating things and changing how the world is perceived in a number of ways, it gets really exciting to to work even harder to be able to be a success within it. Soon enough, all of our everyday devices will be connected through hundreds of thousands lines of codes written by fellow programmers, that is mind-boggling.

It all sounds too much chit-chat and one mor dreamer talking more of his futuristic thesis, but it really is not. This is the reality we are living in and will be living from now on, think back how life was 10 years ago, 2005, the year "the facebook" was founded, life was completely different, largely thanks to technology, and it will be far more different and interesting 10 years from now, the internet will most likely be accessible from every corner of the world, connecting more people, exposing an even larger number of interfaces and interactions for the technology to change habits once thought unchangeable, disrupt industries once thought undisruptable and we programmers will be in the epicenter of all of it, creating all this changes, there is a really good essay on this matter, that most technologists have read, by Marc Andreessen called [Software is eating the world](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460), you should really go check it out, if you haven't already.

To complement my enthusiasm, I would like to point out that at any other point in history (that we know of) we've had this much information and this many opportunities available to us just by having a computer with internet access. The costs to create software companies have gone down to nearly 0, there are companies being created with 100,000 user base that really does not spend that much money to exist, money is not an excuse to not do stuff anymore. The most valuable thing that we have these days is our time, and how we choose to spend it, our time on this earth is counted, that you can be sure of, so make every single second count and strive to achieve all your dreams in life and be a happy person.

Well, to conclude, I would like to point out that this blog is not only going to be about this kind of stuff, I am going to write some technical blog posts relating to iOS Development in Swift, elaborating on my learning while I work on my personal projects. Thank you for reading this, I hope you come back. 


0 - Ok, there might be some other cooler stuff out there, but the conclusion really is about taste.
